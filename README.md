# Nitro + Vanilla Custom Elements

This is a minimal Proof of Concept for using [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io) and vanilla JS custom elements using my [Web Component Base](https://ayco.io/n/web-component-base) class.

## Setting up

Do the following steps to get you started:

0. clone project and go into the directory
```
> git clone https://github.com/ayoayco/nitro-web-components.git
> cd nitro-web-components
```

1. install deps
```
> npm i
```

2. run the dev server
```
> npm run dev
```

3. open the browser to `https://localhost:3000` (or what the dev server said)

This project was generated from Nitro starter guide. Look at the [Nitro documentation](https://nitro.unjs.io/) to learn more.
