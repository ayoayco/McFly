McFly
---

McFly is a framework that grows with you. Start at the very basic of writing HTML files and enhance with standard web technologies or go advanced as you like, at your own pace.

- HTML pages
- Server-Side Rendering logic
- Custom Elements
- REST APIs
- Universal Deployment

...all in the same project.


## Ambitious Goals
We want a way to:
1. create web apps with vanilla custom elements
1. write real .HTML files
1. no frameworks or reactivity libraries on the browser
1. server-side pre-rendering
1. control on when and where JS is downloaded for interactive elements

## Special directories
**1. `src/pages`**
- file based routing for `.html` files
- directly use custom elements (no registry maintenance needed)
- use `<script server:setup>` to define logic that runs on the server, which then gets stripped away

**2. `src/components`**
- custom element constructor class files go here (only `.js` files for now)
- all components are automatically registered using their file names (e.g., a `hello-world.js` component can be used as `<hello-world>` element)

## Setting up

Do the following steps to get you started:

1. clone project and go into the directory
```
git clone https://github.com/ayoayco/mcfly.git
```
```
cd mcfly
```

2. install deps
```
npm i
```

3. run the dev server
```
npm run dev
```

4. open the browser to `https://localhost:3000` (or what the dev server said)

## McFly config

To tell McFly you want to use components, pass the mode (only `"js"` for now) to the `components` prop mcfly.config.ts

```js
import defineConfig from "./packages/define-config";

export default defineConfig({
  components: "js",
});

```


## More info
At the moment, this is a Proof of Concept and testing ground for using [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io) and vanilla JS custom elements using a minimal [Web Component Base](https://ayco.io/n/web-component-base) class.

This project was generated from Nitro starter guide. Look at the [Nitro documentation](https://nitro.unjs.io/) to learn more.
