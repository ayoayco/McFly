## Installation

Run the following to generate a McFly starter project:
```
npm create mcfly@latest
```

## Features
The time has come for vanilla Web tech to be great again. 🎉

✅ Create web apps with vanilla custom elements<br>
✅ Write real .HTML files<br>
✅ Have no frameworks or reactivity libraries on the browser<br>
✅ Use server-side rendering<br>
✅ Deploy anywhere<br>

## Special directories
**1. `src/pages`**
- file based routing for `.html` files
- directly use custom elements & static fragments (no imports or registry maintenance needed)
- use `<script server:setup>` to define logic that runs on the server, which then gets stripped away

**2. `src/components`**
- custom element constructor files (only `.js` files for now)
- all components are automatically registered using their file names; a `hello-world.js` component can be used as `<hello-world>`
- static `.html` fragments; a `my-header.html` fragment can be directly used as `<my-header>`

## Setting up

In this project, we maintain several node workspaces in directories `./packages`, `./site`, and `./templates`.

You can experience the framework now by cloning the project and playing with the example files in the [special directories](#special-directories) for the landing page (`./site/src`).

Do the following steps to get you started:

1. clone project and go into the directory
```
git clone https://github.com/ayoayco/mcfly.git
```
```
cd mcfly
```

2. install deps
```
npm i
```

3. run the dev server
```
npm start
```

4. open the browser to `https://localhost:3000` (or what the dev server said)

## McFly config

To tell McFly you want to use components, pass the mode (only `"js"` for now) to the `components` prop mcfly.config.ts

```js
import defineConfig from "./packages/define-config";

export default defineConfig({
  components: "js",
});

```


## More info
This framework is a result of [an exploration](https://social.ayco.io/@ayo/111195315785886977) for using [**Nitro**](https://nitro.unjs.io) and vanilla JS custom elements using a minimal [**Web Component Base**](https://ayco.io/n/web-component-base) class.

**Nitro** is the same production-grade web server powering [**Nuxt**](https://nuxt.com/)
