# Nitro + Vanilla Custom Elements

This is a Proof of Concept and testing ground for using [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io) and vanilla JS custom elements using my [Web Component Base](https://ayco.io/n/web-component-base) class.

## Setting up

Do the following steps to get you started:

1. clone project and go into the directory
```
git clone https://github.com/ayoayco/nitro-web-components.git
```
```
cd nitro-web-components
```

2. install deps
```
npm i
```

3. run the dev server
```
npm run dev
```

4. open the browser to `https://localhost:3000` (or what the dev server said)

## Ambitious Goals
These items are not yet achieved in this early POC, but what I have in mind starting this is to find a way to:
1. create web apps with vanilla custom elements
1. no frameworks or reactivity libraries on the browser
1. easy server APIs authoring
1. server-side pre-rendering
1. control on when and where JS is downloaded for interactive elements

## More info

This project was generated from Nitro starter guide. Look at the [Nitro documentation](https://nitro.unjs.io/) to learn more.
